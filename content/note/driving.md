I was driving. I wasn't myself. I wanted a different focus.

I wanted the road and the mountains as main characters, but I imagined a circus of figures.

Mechas, animals, airplanes, tanks, balloons, flying saucers, massive people crushing trees with their feet. All of these were terrorizing me.

I forced my head to imagine something else, but it was lost.

I tried to imagine breathing the mountain air, but it was stressful.

I focused on driving, but the cars were menacing.

I was not paying attention, but she kept talking.

I wanted to answer and I was suffocating. I was pushing the words, squeezing my chest.

I felt like a voodoo doll with needles pushing through the ribs and perforating the mind.

I kept throwing some words and it became weird. She gave up.

"Let's stop". It was a good idea. I accepted because I needed to flee.

We stopped at a station, finally. We're safe.

It was cloudy, but I was not prepared for the cold breeze. I closed the door.

"I'm going to the bathroom". "OK" I said, and decided to head to the caf√©.

It was busy. People coming out, others going in.

It was loud. Parts of dialogs were invading me, one by one. None made sense, or they didn't spark any interest.

It was so loud that my brain stopped deciphering for a moment, and all became a drone.

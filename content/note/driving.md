I was driving. Wasn't myself. I wanted distraction.

The road and the mountains were my set, but I imagined a circus.

Mechas, animals, airplanes, tanks, balloons, flying saucers, giraffes, cruise ships, giant people crushing trees with their feet. All were terrorizing me.

I forced my head to imagine something else, but it was lost and tired.

I imagined breathing the mountain air.

One. Two. Three. Four. Hold.

Breathe out. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

It was stressful.

I focused on driving, but the cars were menacing.

Nothing worked.

I was not paying attention, but she kept talking anyway.

I wanted to reply. I was squeezing my chest to get something out.

I felt like a voodoo doll with the needles pushing through and perforating my mind.

I kept throwing a few words, but it became weird, so she gave up.

"Let's stop". I accepted.

We stopped at a station, finally.

It was cloudy, but I was not prepared for the cold. I closed the door and waited.

"I'm going to the bathroom". "OK", I said, and decided to head to the café. I opened the door again and this time the wind cut my face. Felt alive.

The café was busy. Hordes of people.

It was too loud. The windows were foggy. I felt the heat.

Pieces of dialogs were invading me. None made sense.

It was so loud my brain stopped, and the voices became only a drone.

It was scary and cozy. I was not quite sure if I was panicking or enjoying the sound. My heart felt irregular.

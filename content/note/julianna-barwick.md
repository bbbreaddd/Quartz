## The Magic Place

I risk saying this is probably in my top 50 albums of my life. That is saying a lot because I listen to a lot of music and I have a lot of favorite records. This makes me medidade and quasi transcend of how good it makes me feel.

Superb record to listen in the office, for example during cretive exercises.

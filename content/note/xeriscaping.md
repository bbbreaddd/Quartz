3. Drought-tolerant plants.
4. Efficient irrigation.
5. Application of mulch to maximize water retention.
6. Pruning and weeding.

### Layout

- Group plants with similar water needs.
- Consider the sunlight and shade each plant will get.
- Slopes and contours for efficient water runoff.
- Use permeable materials like gravel on pathways to allow water absorption.
- Keep plant sizes in check to prevent overgrowth and increased water use.

### Soil

- Know your soil
- Improve water retention

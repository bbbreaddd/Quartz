I really like this type of graphic novel created by María Medem. The focus on the visuals is immense and the use of colors is phenomenal and attractive to me.

I have to admit that I didn’t fully understand the story. I got some bits and was able to interconnect them. However, I may be wrong, but the focus was not to be more morally conclusive as much as it was to be visually and literally poetic. I got the sense that the idea was to soothe and make readers feel the contexts.

I interpreted in that way, so for me, it was a blast to turn the pages and be surprise by more and more poetry and suggestive imagery.

Knowledge cybernetics is an interdisciplinary framework that sits within complex systems and post-normal science. It focuses on understanding and developing autonomous social collectives, entities that rely on knowledge and its processes to exist and evolve. This concept is a progression of Schwarz's method for modeling viable systems, which integrates various ideas to bridge gaps in understanding how knowledge-driven systems operate. [^1] [^2]

## Classic T-shirt

Bought a few light-colored Classic design t-shirts.

Positives:
- Comfortable fabric. Appears to be durable.
- Quality, rigorous seam lines.
- Good fit and height for my body type.
- Fair price for the quality.

Negatives:
- The neck is slightly wide for my taste.
- The neck is also loose and weirdly finished near the shoulder seam causing a slight lifting off the skin.
- Sleeve design is slightly tight for my taste. I do like goofy, skater-like, loose sleeves, so my fault here. The photos are actually accurate on this point.

## Flannel Shirt

Got one of these in gray twill.

Positives:
- Soft and comfortable fabric.
- The fabric appears to be resistant and of high quality. Needs the washing test.

Negatives:
- A bit short to tuck in.

## The Ground Below Above Our Heads

Absolutely perfect progression, multi-layered, deep and entrancing. I use this for creativity sessions, more for drawing and painting. Itâ€™s quite inspiring to me.

Beautiful, minimal cover with an enigmatic symbol on the center of, probably, a lyzard of some sort arranged in a circle.

![As described before. Background is paper white and in black is the serif font title broken in two, with half above the symbol and the rest below, with Jim's name at the very bottom](../attachment/vsc-paste/jim-orourke-231204115546.png)

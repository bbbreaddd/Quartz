## Maturity stages

1. Building version one — Foundational work
2. Growing adoption — Have people using it
3. Surviving the teenage years — Discovering real-world problems to solve
4. Evolving a healthy product — Sustainability

## Origin

Ben Callahan describes two different points of views in terms of scaling a design system:

- One that comes as a top leadership initiative (Top down)
- One that comes from design necessity (Grassroots)

This forms a sort of spectrum of conditions for design systems to evolve in organizations.

| Top down              | Grassroots            |
| :---                  | :---                  |
| More visibility       | Less visibility       |
| Formal budget         | Informal/no budget    |
| Dedicated team        | No team               |
| Broad scope           | Narrow scope          |
| Leadership pressure   | No expectations       |

Growth can shape differently within this spectrum, to each organization case. For example, take this chart, that shows one can start below and then fluctuate between leadership buy-in and survival mode quickly. The other way around is also possible and has multiple factors affecting it.

## How to mature

Ben describes this as a way to grow between the stages; you continuously practice these actions until at one point, through evaluation, you understand that you can grow to the next stage.

| Educate   | Engage    | Evolve    |
| --        | --        | --        |
| Spread the word | Get others in it | Make it better |
| One-way interaction | Two-way interaction | Iterate and test |

## 1. Building version one

**Educate**

- Define what a design system could be in your organization.
- Share benefits, costs and approach.
- Cast the vision.
- Present it to the broader audience of your organization.

**Engage**

- Discover what will make it right for teams to use — interview, talk with people
- Identify early adopters to use/test

**Evolve**

- Iterate toward the initial release.
- Build a documentation resource.
- Write usage guidelines.

## 2. Growing adoption

**Educate**

- Share each release or evolution bump up.
- Share adoption stories — What little wins could you share to inspire?
- Create and share a roadmap.
- Share the goals and metrics you have defined.

**Engage**

- Gather feedback.
- Get roadmap collaboration — Add your (adopter) own needs to it.
- Support your adopters and, if needed, work closely with them around problems.
- Ask for leadership and adopters support.

**Evolve**

- Documentation to use and effectively adopt it.
- Strategically help it grow by:
  - adding requested features
  - fixing pressing issues/bugs

## 3. Surviving the teenage years

**Educate**

- Capture and share the analytics.
- Effective way to communicate to adopters.
- Explain how to contribute.

**Engage**

- Have design system personnel working in projects.
- Have adopters working sporadically on contributing.
- Directly help onboard into full adoption.
- Have a long-term leadership commitment to support it.

**Evolve**

- Well-oiled and working contribution model.
- Space to add components and guidelines.
- Improvements requests popping up.

Most of these are notes that I took while learning. It is not exactly “vanilla” in the sense that I added or tweaked around according to my own experience with building design systems. I would say it’s about 5% to 10% my own input.

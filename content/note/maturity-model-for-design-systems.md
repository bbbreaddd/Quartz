## Notes based on Ben Callahan’s insights

### Maturity stages

1. Building version one — Foundational work
2. Growing adoption — Have people using it
3. Surviving the teenage years — Discovering real-world problems to solve
4. Evolving a healthy product — Sustainability

### Origin

Ben describes two different points of views in terms of scaling a design system:

- One that comes as a leadership initiative (Top down)
- One that comes from design necessity (Grassroots)

This forms a sort of spectrum of conditions for design systems to evolve in organizations.

| Top down              | Grassroots            |
| :---                  | :---                  |
| More visibility       | Less visibility       |
| Formal budget         | Informal/no budget    |
| Dedicated team        | No team               |
| Broad scope           | Narrow scope          |
| Leadership pressure   | No expectations       |

Growth can shape differently within this spectrum, to each organization case. For example, take this chart, that shows one can start below and then fluctuate between leadership buy-in and survival mode quickly. The other way around is also possible and has multiple factors affecting it.

I’ve been on the lookout for a while into connecting my home switches to my smart devices, like smartphones, tablets and computers, but also to other remote devices, like remotes.

## Need

I want the commodity of having everything centralized. I want to be able to manipulate lighting and blinders switches, but also cameras, remotely, either in bulk, or individually. The advantage would be able to control while in leisure, adjust the room I’m in or while I am away, to be able to bring down the blinders, turn off the lights and potentially turn the cameras on.

## Connection Technologies

So far, I’ve found Zigbee and Wi-Fi to be advantageous over any other types in the market.

### Connection down

Zigbee has the potential of usage without Wi-Fi. Still not sure if this is a fair advantage. To get the full advantage, Zigbee devices have to be connected to a Zigbee receiving hub, so they can synchronize. And to be able to provide some extended functionality, that hub has to connect to Wi-Fi. If I’m away and Wi-Fi is down, I will not be able to connect to my devices anyway.

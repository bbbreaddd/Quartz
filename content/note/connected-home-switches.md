I’ve been on the lookout for a while into connecting my home switches to my smart devices, like smartphones, tablets and computers, but also to other remote devices, like remotes.

I want the commodity of having everything centralized. I want to be able to manipulate lighting and blinders switches, but also cameras, remotely, either in bulk, or individually. The advantage would be able to control while in leisure, adjust the room I’m in or while I am away, to be able to bring down the blinders, turn off the lights and potentially turn the cameras on.

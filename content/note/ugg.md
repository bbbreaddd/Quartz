I got attracted to UGG’s idea of supporting a fair labor scheme, but the reality is I cannot be sure, just hold to their claims… They don’t have any proof, and I just wish they could be more transparent about it.

I do, however, like the use of repurposed materials in some products.

## Scuff Deco slippers

Very comfortable and apparently durable slippers with the leather outer. Then they also use wool and sheepskin. I hope to make these materials last a long time and get this easily repaired by a local cobbler if needed.

## Tasman LTA slippers

I like how durable UGG’s products look, like in this model. The sole seems robust. The seams look strong, and I like the design of this model. I just have to slide in and pull the heel. I hope they can endure for a long time. Repairability doesn’t seem great.

However, the plus side on these would be the recycled materials. Not sure how I can confirm that, but if true, it’s good! So the polyester is recycled, but there is a mix in of natural materials too, even recycled sugarcane waste material. Not bad.

Very comfortable slippers for home office that wear true to size, just have to measure my feet.

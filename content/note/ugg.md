I got attracted to UGG’s idea of supporting a fair labor scheme, but the reality is I cannot be sure, just hold to their claims… They don’t have any proof and I just wish they could be more transparent about it.

I do, however, like the use of repurposed materials in some products.

## Scuff Deco slippers

Very comfortable and apparently durable slippers with the leather outer. Then they also use wool and sheepskin. I hope to make these materials last a long time and get this easily repaired by a local cobbler if needed.

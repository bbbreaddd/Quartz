I got attracted to UGG’s idea of supporting a fair labor scheme, but the reality is I cannot be sure, just hold to their claims… 

## Scuff Deco slippers

Very comfortable and apparently durable slippers with the leather outer. Then they also use wool and sheepskin. I hope to make these materials last a long time and get this easily repaired by a local cobbler if needed. So far, so good.

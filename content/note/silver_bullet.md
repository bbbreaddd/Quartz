I'm very interested in this note-taking app i've bumped into called [Silver Bullet](https://silverbullet.md/).

I have this idea to explore this one for:
- Creating more personal notes, related to tasks or chores,
- Quick annotation,
- Fleeting notes,
- Replace Google Keep.

I want to make sure that:
- It's possible to run on all my devices,
- It's usable on my mobile devices,
- I can access it from an external device,
- It's flawlessly sync-able.

## Zauberberg

With Kassel Jaeger and Akira Rabelais.

It’s a surprising record that I like for the nuanced ambient work. I enjoy when a wave of some recording fades in and out of the picture, evoking feelings from personal experiences with similar sounds.

It’s a very evocative for me and makes a great record to listen to at home, potentially during winter, making me feel inspired to work on new creative projects.

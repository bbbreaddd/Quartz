title: Brain Limiter

As I grow older, internet is becoming  more and more the wrong place for me to look for answers.

I think there is a limit for our brain to absorb content. Mine is filled and tired of intake, up selling, and entrapment. I long for a better relationship with myself, my creative being, and the surroundings, and get other, more dynamic inputs.

That is why I want to start writing more. Establish a dialog with my mind and reflect more on my survival status.

I decided to improve my wardrobe as explained in [Path to a more sustainable wardrobe](../journal/2024010113.md). This page will document what I have chosen in this process.

## T-shirts

- [Isto Classic T-shirt](brands/isto.md)

## Shirts

- [Isto Flannel Shirt](brands/isto.md)

## Socks

- [Falke Sensitive London](brands/falke.md) but Iâ€™m looking for a better alternative in terms of materials.

## Slippers

- [UGG Scuff Deco](brands/ugg.md)
- [UGG Tasman LTA](brands/ugg.md)

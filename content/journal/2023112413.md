Quick study on mouse pointers designs. I want to make something inspired by nautical instruments. Kind of like a compass needle but more akin to a regular mouse pointer. I don’t want to confuse people too much so it’s effectively a mouse pointer.

I think I’m going forward with the second one. There’s enough in it that points into nautical and cartography context but it still looks familiar enough as a mouse pointer.

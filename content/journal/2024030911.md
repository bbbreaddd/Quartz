I visited Berlin this week to attend an open-source focused conference: the FOSS Backstage, plus the extra day dedicated to design.

Percona sponsored my visit, which I appreciate a lot, and we got the chance to give visibility to what we do in the database software and services space. But also I got the chance to take personal advantage, from not only this event and its people, but also from the city.

Looking back, the conference was useful. The venue was very cool and comfortable. The people attending were friendly and genuine, which makes me love open-source more. The need for design surprised me and made me confident. The talks were underwhelming with some of them being lower in quality, unprepared, lacking substance and usefulness.

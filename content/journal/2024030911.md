I visited Berlin this week to attend an open-source focused conference: the FOSS Backstage, plus the extra day dedicated to design.

Percona sponsored my visit, which I appreciate a lot, and we got the chance to give visibility to what we do in the database software and services space. But also I got the chance to take personal advantage, from not only this event and its people, but also from the city.

# Cardoon

Doing some exercises around cardoons, or thistles. My family name is Cardoso and itâ€™s a name derived from the cardoon significance, where this family crest has a cardoon on it.

I am looking to examine how a cardoon is made so I can create some artwork around it for my next personal website. Also looking to honor this family name with very good women and men that walked this earth.

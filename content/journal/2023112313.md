# Cardoon

Doing some exercises around cardoons, or thistles. My family name is Cardoso, and itâ€™s a name derived from the cardoon significance, where this family crest has a cardoon on it.

I am looking to examine how a cardoon is made, so I can create some artwork around it for my next personal website. Also looking to honor this family name with very good, humble women and men that walked this earth with a lot of sacrifice for the newer generations like me.

I recently launched a new front-end for my personal website: [PMCF.XYZ](https://www.pmcf.xyz). In the process of designing, I got plenty of loose ends. As I was coding, I was still deciding on some details and iterating on it.

I knew from the start that I wanted to include some cardoons, either illustrated or as a logo of some sort, a symbol. I wanted that as it had a significance to me, itâ€™s related to my family name. So I started [sketching it](2023112313) to see what could come from it.

It appears that note-taking is hard work. I have many ideas brewing in my head, but the conditions to capture them are not always ideal. I may be taking care of my daughter or showering or whatever. To be efficient I’d have to:
1. stop,
2. fetch an annotation medium,
3. think,
4. and write.

Like I am doing right now, on a computer. And this usually takes some time that I could be using for something else. Just capture the idea, like snapping fingers, and walk away.

I know that voice recording seems to be way quicker, but you still require a device to record. It needs to be with you, and you have to still stop and record. And the output is a lousy audio that is nearly unusable to me. I don’t like to replay and stay put to listen. Reading note is a far superior experience for me. My eyes can skim text at the speed of light.

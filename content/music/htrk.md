## Nostalgia

Incredibly satisfying to me. It sounds like motorized rock with the metals shimmering and the bass filling in the space. Also like the sound dirtiness captured in the recording.

## Work (Work, Work)

Approachable and simple album with excellent melodies and trance-y motorizations that goes a lot to the #industrial side of things.

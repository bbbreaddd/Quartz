Dirty, grainy, reverberated guitars. Just how I like it. Channeling some Jesus and Mary Chain. All tracks are go. Suede cover is excellent. The ambient tracks are a delight.

###### LP cover

I prefer the packaging of this LP over the other version I’ve found on Discogs. The photos and the band’s name bind very well, looking a bit eerie.

## Self-titled

Dirty, grainy, reverberated guitars. Just how I like it. Channeling some Jesus and Mary Chain. All tracks are go. Suede cover is excellent. The ambient tracks are a delight.

###### LP cover

I prefer the packaging of this LP over the other version I’ve found on Discogs. The photos and the band’s name bind very well, looking a bit eerie.

![Photo of a rudimentary stone archway, potentially medieval, with a cross engraving on the top middle of the arch. The photo is in black and white, printed on a brownish cardboard material, making it look mysterious and eerie](flying_saucer_attack-1700153261777.jpeg)

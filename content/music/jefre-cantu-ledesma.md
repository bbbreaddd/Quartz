## Music from the Headlands Center For The Arts, volumes 1 to 7

Like the experimental quality and how unexpected they sound. Great for work and to trance. Sometimes ethereal. Sometimes dirty and grainy, melancholic. Energetic, simple, surprising. A good layering to enjoy throughout.

I enjoy this type of uncompromised art and it reminds me a lot how it should be most of the time: instinctive. My sole, humble opinion.

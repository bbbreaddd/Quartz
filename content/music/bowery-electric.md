## Beat

[Album on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/master/21588-Bowery-Electric-Beat)

Excellent rhythm for my studio. Enticing drum rolls up my spine. Love the tempo and how it reminds me to appreciate living at a slower pace.

The main cover’s simplicity is my bread and butter. I’m hungry for this aesthetics. Love the title’s extended style of typography.

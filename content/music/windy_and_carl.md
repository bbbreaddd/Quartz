Magic, spacey, enthralling. It's like drug-music that keeps repeating the pattern with slight shifts, and it entrances the mind.

Some of my favorite albums and respective cover art below.

## Portal

Cassette sleeve:

![Black and white drawing of an alien-like cityscape, with some grass (?) beneath, and  with a huge alien figure hovering the city. Above the alien's head is the name of the band and the album](windy_and_carl-1699348737359.jpeg)

LP cover:

![Greenish and blueish photography of what appears to be an underwater view of floating ice slabs. Overlaid, a subtle typography with the band and the album names](windy_and_carl-1699376241744.jpeg)

![Presumably the back art with a collage of different landscapes of Antarctica (probably) depicting ice seas and ice mountains](windy_and_carl-1699376629806.jpeg)

CD cover:

![Greenish photography of what appears to be an underwater view of floating ice slabs. This one so abstract that appears to be clouds instead. Overlaid, a subtle typography with the band and the album names](windy_and_carl-1699376118898.jpeg)

![Another shot similar to the previous one, just a different view of the ice](windy_and_carl-1699376569933.jpeg)

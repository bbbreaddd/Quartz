- [Introspection](#introspection)

## Portal

Magic, spacey, enthralling. It's like drug-music that keeps repeating the pattern with slight shifts, and it entrances the mind.

###### Cassette sleeve

## Drawing of sound

## Antarctica

https://www.discogs.com/master/9747-Windy-Carl-Antarctica-The-Bliss-Out-Vol-2

I like this one a lot. It's more repetitive and minimal but has a lot of heart and swinging subtleties that soothes the mind. It's less psychedelic and more introspective, in my view.

###### LP cover

![Greenish and blueish photography of what appears to be an underwater view of floating ice slabs. Overlaid, a subtle typography with the band and the album names](windy_and_carl-1699376241744.jpeg)

![Presumably the back art with a collage of different landscapes of Antarctica (probably) depicting ice seas and ice mountains](windy_and_carl-1699376629806.jpeg)

###### CD cover

![Greenish photography of what appears to be an underwater view of floating ice slabs. This one so abstract that appears to be clouds instead. Overlaid, a subtle typography with the band and the album names](windy_and_carl-1699376118898.jpeg)

![Another shot similar to the previous one, just a different view of the ice](windy_and_carl-1699376569933.jpeg)

## Depths

More refined, ambient-structured and drone-y.

## Introspection

A collection of singles and rarities between the years 1993 and 2000. Super-worth, beautiful and inspiring. A very long play distributed into three compact discs.

I'm a sucker for drone tracks like “After the flood”. It's like a big, voluminous cloud traversing my mind, and leaves me in a positive creative mood.

###### CD cover

![It's a night photo of Windy and Carl on a stage performing. Their figures are a bit distorted and ghost-like due to the lighting conditions and the blurriness of the photo and the printing](windy_and_carl-1699607248907.jpeg)

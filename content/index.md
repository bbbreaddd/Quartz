Welcome to this website!

My name is Pedro. I live in Lisbon, Portugal, with my wife and daughter. I work as a product designer, and I categorize myself as a creative person. I love arts, experimenting with expressing inner feelings, experiences, stories, beliefs and passing useful messages.

Here in this digital garden, I am mostly writing for myself, taking notes that may come in handy to generate new ideas for anyone, including me, to pick them up. I believe in shared notes and e-societies. 

Website built and redesigned by me in 2023 using:
- [Lexend typefaces](https://www.lexend.com/) by Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin;
- Written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/);
- And it was rendered with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) made by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/).

This is a very beautiful piece of web work. I can't help but think about the [Paper-like Web](paper-like_web.md) concept here. And the website author, Nicholas Rougeux, did an excellent work. I already added it to favorites. I want to be able to use it as a reference for my drawings and paintings, and maybe for web projects.

I like how this catalog, made by Patrick Syme, was using Abraham Werner's **textual description of the colors**. It's crazy to think about the accuracy! Would difficult it must have been. There's certainly a huge error margin but the result is beautiful anyway, and I like that I can look it up in real life like a painter would in the year 1814.
